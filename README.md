# CLOUD-SECURITY-IMPLEMENTATION

**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME**: ADARSH VERMA

**INTERN ID**: CT6WGGP

**DOMAIN**: CLOUD COMPUTING 

**BATCH DURATION**: DECEMBER 25TH,2024 to FEBURARY 10TH,2025

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTOSH

**DESCRIPTION** 

This task involves configuring robust security mechanisms to protect resources and sensitive data in a cloud environment. The implementation includes three primary components: Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, secure data storage, and encryption for data at rest and in transit.

Identity and Access Management (IAM):
IAM policies are configured to enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure the principle of least privilege is applied. This setup involves defining user roles, managing permissions, and implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security. Service accounts with scoped permissions are created for applications to access resources securely.

Secure Storage:
Data storage services are configured to limit access through bucket/container-level policies. Storage is secured by enabling private access by default and applying lifecycle policies to manage data retention. Object-level logging and monitoring are enabled to track and audit activities on stored data, ensuring full visibility into storage operations.

Data Encryption:
Encryption mechanisms are applied to safeguard data both at rest and in transit. At-rest encryption uses cloud-native key management services (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or Google KMS), while in-transit encryption ensures secure communication channels via HTTPS or TLS protocols. Key rotation and proper key management practices are established to maintain the integrity of encryption.

Outcome:
The deliverables include a fully configured cloud environment with secured access, protected storage, and encrypted data. A detailed report will document the implemented security measures, validation results, and recommendations for ongoing security improvements
